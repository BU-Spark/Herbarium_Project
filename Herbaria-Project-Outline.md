# Herbaria Project Outline

### *Smriti Suresh, Dima Kazlouski, Douglas Moy - 2023-10-06 v1.0.0-dev*

## Overview

The changing climate increases stressors that weaken plant resilience, disrupting forest structure and ecosystem services. Rising temperatures lead to more frequent droughts, wildfires, and invasive pest outbreaks, leading to the loss of plant species. That has numerous detrimental effects, including lowered productivity, the spread of invasive plants, vulnerability to pests, altered ecosystem structure, etc. The project aims to aid climate scientists in capturing patterns in plant life concerning changing climate.
The herbarium specimens are pressed plant samples stored on paper. The specimen labels are handwritten and date back to the early 1900s. The labels contain the curator's name, their institution, the species and genus, and the date the specimen was collected. Since the labels are handwritten, they are not readily accessible from an analytical standpoint. The data, at this time, cannot be analyzed to study the impact of climate on plant life.
The digitized samples are an invaluable source of information for climate change scientists, and are providing key insights into biodiversity change over the last century. Digitized specimens will facilitate easier dissemination of information and allow more people access to data. The project, if successful, would enable users from various domains in environmental science to further studies pertaining to climate change and its effects on flora and even fauna.


### A. Problem Statement:

Develop a machine learning solution for automating the extraction and digitization of critical information from handwritten labels on historical herbarium specimens, dating back to the early 1900s. Other potential problems to tackle are segmeneting non-relevant parts of the image, and building a classifier for the image itself. 


### B. Checklist for project completion

1. Increase evaluation dataset to 1000 images
2. Improve transcription accuracy of the taxon label
3. Extract and transcribe the following for minimal metadata capture:
    a. Geography 
    b. Collection code
    c. Barcode
4. For detailed data capture:
    a. Date Collected
    b. Collector Name
    c. Collector Number
    d. Habitat
5. Produce clean code and documentation


### C. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI.

1. OCR and Transcription Improvement:

A person would look at the plant image embedded with text, aiming to transcribe this text. Their primary focus is on the taxon label, and the surrounding textual content within the image. In addition, they would be on the lookout for specific items such as geography, collection code, barcode, date collected, collector name, collector number, and habitat.

To ensure accuracy, this person would cross-reference the taxon label with a known list, ensuring it's either a valid label or closely matching one. If they encounter text that's challenging to interpret, they would draw from adjacent text or other contextual cues within the image to infer the likely content. This detailed transcription and validation task aligns well with capabilities of state-of-the-art OCR models, especially with refinements to prioritize the extraction of these newly outlined items.

2. Plant Classification:

Once textual content is identified or masked, the person would then shift their focus to the visual aspects of the plant image. Drawing from their prior knowledge of known plant categories, as well as potential hints from the transcribed information like the taxon label, geography, and collection code, they would determine the plant's identity. Recognizing a plant based on its visual characteristics and aligning it with external clues remains a task achievable with AI, particularly when using advanced computer vision methods and a robust training dataset.

3. Plant Features Identification:

Upon examining the plant image, the person would mark out specific features like fruits and flowers, noting their locations. They would count the number of such features and also categorize them based on their phenological stage, i.e., the stage in their life cycle. This identification and classification step pertains to AI's capabilities in image segmentation and classification, given a well-structured dataset. in.


### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

The proposed workflow for digitizing herbarium specimen is as follows:

- Imaging: A customized photo station for imaging herbarium sheets and an automated image processing pipeline is used for digitizing the sheets.
- Label transcription: Extracting the label from the specimen sheet, transcribing the label:
-- Minimal metadata capture 
-- Detailed data capture
- Georeferencing: generation of latitude, longitude, and associated uncertainties.

After the above mentioned processing, we aim to provide the consolidated dataset of herbaria specimen with the desired labels of Taxon, Geography, Collection Code, Barcode, Location, Date Collected, Collector Name, Collector Number, Habitat, etc. to the end-users i.e. climate change scientists, to help in providing key insights into biodiversity change in the age of the Anthropocene.

Final Format/Technology used to generate the output files will be updated subsequently after discussion with client. Possible hypothesized outputs include a fully functioning dynamic website with the Herbaria specimen sorted according to various features, for easy accessibility and reach by end-users.
