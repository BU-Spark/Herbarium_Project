# ML-Herbarium Project [the project is continuing this semester and there will be updates to the file as the semester continues]

This repository contains a software pipeline to process herbarium specimens. There are currently three tasks this project aims to accomplish: 1. classifying specimens via optical character recognition (OCR) and named entity recognition (NER), 2. classifying specimens via image classification, and 3. identifying the phenology of specimens.

## Getting Started
Each of the aformentioned tasks is contained in its own folder. The primary task is in the `transcription` folder, the secondary in the `vision` folder, and the tertiary in the `phenology` folder. Each folder contains a `README.md` file that describes the task and how to run the code.
