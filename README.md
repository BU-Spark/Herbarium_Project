# Herbarium_Project

For our final deliverable, we have a pipeline to segment the labels from the full specimen images, and another pipeline that will output label transcriptions
for images it was able to correctly identify. Both work on images/data stored in the global "in_data" folder. 

The segmentation is located in the `segmentation` folder and the transcription is located in the `transcription` folder, with further instructions in each
folder respectively.
