    "This notebook utilizes Azure AI Document Intelligence Studio to extract text from a set of Herbarium specimens, obtained from: https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/gallery?basis_of_record=PRESERVED_SPECIMEN&media_ty%5B%E2%80%A6%5Daxon_key=6&year=1000,1941&advanced=1&occurrence_status=present\n",
    "\n",
    "A selection of 30 specimens was downloaded to the /projectnb/sparkgrp/ml-herbarium-grp/fall2023/LLM_Specimens folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "The folder is made up of:\n",
    "1) 20 images that contain pure text, ranging from plain to hard-to-read-cursive and 1\n",
    "2) 10 images that contain both the visual plant specimen and the attached textual labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Special care was taken to select a diverse collection of specimens, ranging in text quality and type\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to the 10 images: there was a general trend in that the images with plant specimens and the actual text, the text was too small and or blurry to be deciphered by any LLM. Next steps would include improving the quality of the text for the LLM to analyze it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently: the notebook takes an input image from: /projectnb/sparkgrp/ml-herbarium-grp/fall2023/LLM_Specimens, runs it through Azure Vision, analyzes all text, creates a pdf with the original image, an annotated image that has boxes around identified words and predicted words written over the original text. Below the image the entire text identified is printed along with the confidence score for each identified term. All this is saved and stored in: /projectnb/sparkgrp/ml-herbarium-grp/fall2023/AzureVision-results\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediate next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain a student Microsoft Azure account to finish the work (testing was done with a personal account, ran out of free credits)\n",
    "2. Improve annotated images- currently the predicted text is hard to read, going to change it so that its above the orginal words. \n",
    "3. Integrate GPT-4 to parse the written text into a format that clearly returns the species, date collected, geography. \n"
